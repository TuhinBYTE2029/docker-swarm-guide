## Why Docker Swarm in 2026?

Before the Kubernetes crowd jumps in - yes, I know K8s exists. But here's the thing: **Docker Swarm is still incredibly relevant in 2026**, especially for small-to-medium teams who want container orchestration without the complexity overhead.

Swarm advantages:
- Native Docker integration (no YAML hell beyond compose files)
- Significantly lower learning curve
- Perfect for 2-20 node clusters
- Built-in service discovery and load balancing
- Rolling updates out of the box
- Works with your existing Docker Compose files (mostly)

If you're not running thousands of microservices across multiple data centers, Swarm might be exactly what you need.

---

## Understanding the Docker Swarm Hierarchy

Before diving into configs, you need to understand how Swarm is organized. Think of it as concentric circles moving inward:

```
Swarm → Nodes → Stacks → Services → Tasks (Containers)
```

### Swarm
The outer ring - it's your entire cluster. As long as you have one Manager node, you have a Swarm. Swarm only works with **pre-built images** - there's no `docker build` in production. Images must be pushed to a registry (Docker Hub, ECR, etc.) beforehand. This is by design - production deployments need to be fast.

### Nodes
Physical or virtual hosts in your cluster. Two types:
- **Managers**: Handle cluster state and scheduling
- **Workers**: Run your containers

**Pro tip**: For high availability, use 3 or 5 managers (odd numbers for quorum). We run a 2-node setup (1 manager, 1 worker) which works fine but has no manager redundancy.

### Stacks
Groups of related services defined in a compose file. Think of a Stack as a "deployment unit" - when you deploy a stack, all its services come up together.

### Services
The workhorse of Swarm. A service manages multiple container replicas and handles:
- Load balancing between replicas
- Rolling updates
- Health monitoring
- Automatic restart on failure

### Tasks
This trips people up. In Swarm terminology, a **Task = Container**. When you scale a service to 6 replicas, you have 6 tasks. The scheduler dispatches tasks to available nodes.

## VPS Requirements & Cost Planning

Before spinning up servers, here's what you actually need. Docker Swarm is lightweight - the overhead is minimal compared to Kubernetes.

### Infrastructure Presets

| Preset | Nodes | Layout | Min Specs (per node) | Use Case |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | 1 | 1 manager | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB | Dev/testing only |
| **Basic** | 2 | 1 manager + 1 worker | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB | Small production |
| **Standard** | 3 | 1 manager + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | Standard production |
| **HA** | 5 | 3 managers + 2 workers | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB | High availability |
| **Enterprise** | 8 | 3 managers + 5 workers | 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 160GB | Large scale |

**Why these numbers?**
- **1GB RAM minimum**: Swarm itself uses ~100-200MB, but you need headroom for containers
- **3 or 5 managers for HA**: Raft consensus requires odd numbers for quorum
- **2 vCPU for production**: Single core gets bottlenecked during deployments

### Approximate Monthly Costs (2025/2026)

| Provider | Basic (2 nodes) | Standard (3 nodes) | HA (5 nodes) | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------| ------|
| **Hetzner** | ~€8-12 | ~€20-30 | ~€40-60 | Cheapest, EU-focused |
| **Vultr** | ~$12-20 | ~$30-50 | ~$60-100 | Good global coverage |
| **DigitalOcean** | ~$16-24 | ~$40-60 | ~$80-120 | Great UX, pricier |
| **Linode** | ~$14-22 | ~$35-55 | ~$70-110 | Solid middle ground |
| **AWS EC2** | ~$20-40 | ~$50-100 | ~$100-200 | Most expensive, most features |

*Prices based on comparable instance types. Actual costs depend on specific configurations.*

### My Recommendation

For most small-to-medium teams:

1. **Start with Basic (2 nodes)** - 1 manager + 1 worker on Vultr or Hetzner
2. **Budget ~$20-40/month** for a production-ready setup
3. **Add nodes as needed** - Swarm makes scaling easy

If you need HA from day one, the **Standard (3 nodes)** preset gives you redundancy without breaking the bank at ~$30-50/month on Vultr/Hetzner.

### What About AWS/GCP/Azure?

Cloud giants work fine with Swarm, but:
- **More expensive** for equivalent specs
- **More complexity** (VPCs, security groups, IAM)
- **Better if** you need other AWS services (RDS, S3, etc.)

We run Swarm on AWS EC2 because we're already deep in the AWS ecosystem. If you're starting fresh, a dedicated VPS provider is simpler and cheaper.

## Setting Up Your Production Environment

### Step 1: Install Docker (The Right Way)

On Ubuntu (tested on 20.04/22.04/24.04):

```bash
# Clean up any old installations
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do
    sudo apt-get remove $pkg
done

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Add your user to docker group (logout/login after)
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Important:** Use `docker compose` (with a space), not `docker-compose`. The latter is deprecated.

### Step 2: Initialize the Swarm

This is where people mess up on AWS/cloud environments. You have multiple network interfaces, so you MUST specify the advertise address:

```bash
# Get your internal IP
ip addr

# Initialize Swarm on the manager (replace with your internal IP)
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.1.141:2377 --listen-addr 10.10.1.141:2377
```

The output gives you a join token. Save it! Workers use this to join:

```bash
# On worker nodes
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xxxxx... 10.10.1.141:2377
```

**Critical for HA**: Use a fixed IP address for the advertise address. If the whole swarm restarts and every manager node gets a new IP address, there's no way for any node to contact an existing manager.

---

## DNS Configuration (This Will Save You Hours of Debugging)

**CRITICAL**: DNS issues cause 90% of Swarm networking problems. Docker runs its own DNS server at `127.0.0.11` for container-to-container communication.

For internal service discovery (especially important on AWS), set up an internal DNS server. We use Bind9 on a dedicated host:

### On Each Swarm Node

Edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS=10.10.1.122 8.8.8.8
Domains=~yourdomain.io
```

Then reboot the node.

### Why This Matters

Without proper DNS:
- Containers can't resolve other services by name
- You'll see random connection timeouts
- Round-trip to external DNS adds latency
- Service discovery breaks silently

**Rule of thumb**: Never hardcode IP addresses in Swarm. Services come and go - let Docker handle routing via service names.

### Docker's Internal DNS (127.0.0.11)

Docker runs its own DNS server at `127.0.0.11` for container-to-container resolution. Some applications (like Postfix) need this explicitly configured:

```dockerfile
# In your Dockerfile - for apps that need DNS config
RUN echo "nameserver 127.0.0.11" >> /var/spool/postfix/etc/resolv.conf
```

This is especially important for services that chroot or have their own resolv.conf handling.

---

## Network Configuration: The Secret Sauce

Create a user-defined overlay network. This is **mandatory** for multi-node communication:

```bash
docker network create \
  --opt encrypted \
  --subnet 172.240.0.0/24 \
  --gateway 172.240.0.254 \
  --attachable \
  --driver overlay \
  awsnet
```

Let me break down these flags:

| Flag | Why It's Important |
|------|-------------------|
| `--opt encrypted` | Enables IPsec encryption for inter-node traffic. Optional but recommended for security. **Note:** Can cause issues in AWS/cloud with NAT - use internal VPC IPs if you enable this |
| `--subnet` | Prevents conflicts with AWS VPC ranges and default Docker networks |
| `--attachable` | Allows standalone containers (like monitoring agents) to connect |
| `--driver overlay` | Required for Swarm networking across nodes |

**Pro tip**: If you're using Postfix for email relay, whitelist your Docker subnet (e.g., `172.240.0.0/24`) in the relay configuration.

### Required Ports for Swarm Communication

Ensure these ports are open between nodes:
- **TCP 2377**: Cluster management communications
- **TCP/UDP 7946**: Communication among nodes
- **TCP/UDP 4789**: Overlay network traffic

---

## The Compose File Deep Dive

Here's a production-ready compose file with explanations:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  nodeserver:
    # ALWAYS specify your DNS server for internal resolution
    dns:
      - 10.10.1.122

    # Use init for proper signal handling and zombie process cleanup
    init: true

    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      # Reference .env variables with ${VAR}
      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
      - NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=300

    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 6

      placement:
        # Spread across nodes - max 3 per node means 6 replicas need 2+ nodes
        max_replicas_per_node: 3

      update_config:
        # Rolling updates: 2 at a time with 10s delay
        parallelism: 2
        delay: 10s
        # Rollback on failure
        failure_action: rollback
        order: start-first  # New containers start before old ones stop

      rollback_config:
        parallelism: 2
        delay: 10s

      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s

      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.50'
          memory: 400M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.20'
          memory: 150M

    # Build is IGNORED in Swarm - image must be pre-built
    build:
      context: ./nodeserver

    image: "yourregistry/nodeserver:latest"

    # Only container port - Docker handles host port assignment
    ports:
      - "61339"

    volumes:
      - nodeserver-logs:/var/log

    networks:
      awsnet:

    secrets:
      - app_secrets

# Must declare volumes at root level
volumes:
  nodeserver-logs:

# External secrets (created in Portainer or via CLI)
secrets:
  app_secrets:
    external: true

# External network (pre-created with our custom config)
networks:
  awsnet:
    external: true
    name: awsnet
```

### Key Deploy Settings Explained

**Parallelism & Updates:**
```yaml
update_config:
  parallelism: 2
  delay: 10s
```
With 6 replicas and parallelism of 2, Swarm updates 2 containers at a time. If they come up healthy, it proceeds to the next 2. This ensures zero downtime and automatic rollback if the new image fails.

**Resource Limits:**
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpus: '0.50'
    memory: 400M
```
Always set these! Without limits, a misbehaving container can starve the entire node.

**Init Process:**
```yaml
init: true
```
This runs a tiny init system (tini) as PID 1. It handles:
- Signal forwarding to your application
- Zombie process reaping
- Proper shutdown sequences

Without this, orphaned processes accumulate and `SIGTERM` might not reach your app.

## Dockerfile Best Practices for Swarm

Since Swarm only works with pre-built images, your Dockerfile quality matters even more. Let me share real production Dockerfiles I've refined over years.

### Multi-Stage Builds (The Right Way)

Multi-stage builds keep your final image small and secure. Here's a standard Node.js example:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ============================================
# STAGE 1: Base with build dependencies
# ============================================
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS base

WORKDIR /app

# Install build tools needed for native npm packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 \
    make \
    g++ \
    && apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy package files first (layer caching optimization)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# ============================================
# STAGE 2: Install dependencies
# ============================================
FROM base AS compiled

RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# ============================================
# STAGE 3: Final production image
# ============================================
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS final

# Set timezone
RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime \
    && echo America/New_York > /etc/timezone

WORKDIR /app

# Copy ONLY the compiled node_modules from build stage
COPY --from=compiled /app/node_modules /app/node_modules

# Copy application code
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "--trace-warnings", "./server.js"]
```

**Why multi-stage?**
- Build tools (python3, make, g++) stay in the `base` stage
- Final image is clean `node:20-bookworm-slim` without build dependencies
- Significantly smaller image size
- Security: No compilers/build tools for attackers to exploit

### Hybrid Python + Node.js Dockerfile

Sometimes you need both Python and Node.js - for example, when your app requires Chromium for PDF generation, Python-based build tools, or data processing scripts. Here's a real production example:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ============================================
# STAGE 1: Python base with Node.js installed
# ============================================
FROM python:bookworm AS base

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="Your Name <you@example.com>"

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd --gid 1000 node \
  && useradd --uid 1000 --gid node --shell /bin/bash --create-home node

# Install Node.js, Yarn, and Python tools
RUN \
  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_20.x nodistro main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list && \
  wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg && \
  apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  chromium \
  nodejs && \
  pip install -U pip && pip install pipenv && \
  apt-get clean && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set timezone
RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime \
    && echo America/New_York > /etc/timezone

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# ============================================
# STAGE 2: Install Node dependencies
# ============================================
FROM base AS compiled

RUN npm install --omit=dev

# ============================================
# STAGE 3: Final production image
# ============================================
FROM base AS final

# Copy compiled node_modules from build stage
COPY --from=compiled /app/node_modules /app/node_modules

# Copy application code
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "--trace-warnings", "./server.js"]
```

**When to use Python + Node hybrid:**
- PDF generation with Puppeteer/Chromium
- Data processing pipelines mixing Python and Node
- Build systems requiring Python tools (Poetry, pipenv)
- ML/AI features alongside a Node.js web server

### Nginx with ModSecurity WAF

Here's a real Nginx Dockerfile with ModSecurity WAF compiled in:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
ARG NGINX_VERSION=1.27.0

FROM nginx:$NGINX_VERSION as base

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y git dos2unix apt-utils autoconf automake \
    build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libgeoip-dev \
    liblmdb-dev libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libtool libxml2-dev \
    libyajl-dev pkgconf wget tar zlib1g-dev && \
    ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

# Clone and build ModSecurity
RUN git clone --depth 1 -b v3/master --single-branch https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity

WORKDIR /ModSecurity

RUN git submodule init && git submodule update && \
    ./build.sh && ./configure && make && make install

# Build Nginx ModSecurity module
RUN git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx.git && \
    wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-$NGINX_VERSION.tar.gz && \
    tar zxvf nginx-$NGINX_VERSION.tar.gz

WORKDIR /ModSecurity/nginx-$NGINX_VERSION

RUN ./configure --with-compat --add-dynamic-module=../ModSecurity-nginx && \
    make modules && \
    cp objs/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /usr/lib/nginx/modules

# ============================================
# Final stage - clean image with just the module
# ============================================
FROM nginx:$NGINX_VERSION AS final

# Copy the compiled module from build stage
COPY --from=base /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so /usr/lib/nginx/modules/
COPY --from=base /usr/local/modsecurity/ /usr/local/modsecurity/

COPY nginx/ /etc/nginx/

RUN mkdir -p /var/cache/nginx_cache && \
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/* /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

EXPOSE 80 443
```

The key insight: **Build ModSecurity in a temp stage, copy only the compiled `.so` module to the final image.**

### Key Dockerfile Rules:

**1. Always Run in Foreground**
```dockerfile
# When building nginx from a base OS image (debian, ubuntu, etc.):
# WRONG - daemon mode, container exits immediately
CMD ["nginx"]

# RIGHT - foreground mode
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# NOTE: The official nginx Docker image already includes "daemon off;"
# so you don't need to specify it when using FROM nginx:x.x.x

# For Postfix:
CMD ["/usr/sbin/postfix", "start-fg"]
```

Containers need a foreground process to stay alive. If your process daemonizes, the container thinks "my job is done" and exits.

**2. Handle Cross-Platform Line Endings**

If you develop on Windows but deploy to Linux, line endings can break everything:

```dockerfile
# Install dos2unix and convert files
RUN apt-get install -y dos2unix && \
    dos2unix /etc/myapp/config.conf && \
    dos2unix /scripts/entrypoint.sh
```

This has saved me hours of debugging "file not found" errors that were actually `\r\n` vs `\n` issues.

**3. Pin Your Base Images**
```dockerfile
# BAD - "latest" changes without warning
FROM ubuntu:latest

# BETTER - version pinned
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# BEST - SHA pinned (immutable)
FROM ubuntu@sha256:abc123...
```

**4. Include Health Checks**
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost/health || exit 1
```

Swarm uses health checks for:
- Deciding when a container is ready for traffic
- Triggering restarts on failure
- Rolling update decisions

**5. Use .dockerignore**

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude sensitive/unnecessary files:

```
# Secrets - NEVER include in images
**/secrets.json
**/.env
**/sasl_passwd

# Development files
**/.git
**/.gitignore
**/node_modules
**/*.log
**/npm-debug.log

# Source maps (if you don't need debugging)
**/*.js.map

# IDE files
**/.vscode
**/.idea

# Test files
**/test
**/tests
**/__tests__
```

This keeps your images small and prevents accidental secret exposure.

## Advanced Compose Patterns

### Build Cache Optimization

Speed up builds with `cache_from`:

```yaml
build:
  context: ./aws-nodeserver
  cache_from:
    - "yourregistry/nodeserver:latest"
  args:
    - BUILD_VERSION=${BUILD_VERSION}
    - GIT_COMMIT=${LONG_COMMIT}
image: "yourregistry/nodeserver:${DOCKER_BUILD_VERSION:-latest}"
```

Docker will use layers from the cached image when possible. This can cut build times from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

### Environment Variable Defaults

Use `${VAR:-default}` syntax for fallback values:

```yaml
environment:
  - NGINX_RESOLVER=${NGINX_RESOLVER:-127.0.0.11}
  - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-production}

image: "yourregistry/app:${DOCKER_BUILD_VERSION:-latest}"
```

### Placement Constraints

Control where services run:

```yaml
deploy:
  placement:
    # Run only on workers (not managers)
    constraints: [node.role == worker]

    # Or only on managers
    constraints: [node.role == manager]

    # Or specific nodes by label
    constraints:
      - node.role == manager
      - node.labels.monitoring == true
```

Useful for:
- Running databases only on nodes with SSDs
- Keeping CPU-intensive work off the manager
- Pinning monitoring services to labeled nodes

**To add a label to a node:**
```bash
docker node update --label-add monitoring=true docker1.yourdomain.io
```

### Global Mode Deployment

For monitoring agents that need to run on **every node**:

```yaml
cadvisor:
  image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:v0.47.0
  deploy:
    mode: global  # Runs ONE instance on EVERY node
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 128M
      reservations:
        memory: 64M
```

Use `mode: global` for:
- Monitoring agents (cAdvisor, node-exporter)
- Log collectors
- Security agents
- Anything that needs host-level access on all nodes

### Full Rollback Configuration

Production-ready update and rollback config:

```yaml
deploy:
  rollback_config:
    parallelism: 1
    delay: 20s
    monitor: 10s  # Watch for this long before considering update successful
  update_config:
    parallelism: 2
    delay: 70s
    failure_action: rollback  # Auto-rollback on failure
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    delay: 70s
    max_attempts: 30  # Higher for production stability
    window: 120s
```

**Key settings:**
- `monitor: 10s` - How long to watch the new container before proceeding
- `failure_action: rollback` - Automatically rollback if update fails
- `max_attempts: 30` - More retries for transient failures in production
- `delay: 70s` - Longer delays give services time to stabilize

### Docker Configs (Non-Sensitive Configuration)

Secrets are for sensitive data. **Configs** are for non-sensitive configuration files:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    configs:
      - nginx_blocked_ips
    # ...

configs:
  nginx_blocked_ips:
    external: true  # Created in Portainer or via CLI
```

Create a config:
```bash
docker config create nginx_blocked_ips ./blockips.conf
```

Configs appear in the container at `/config_name` by default, or you can specify a path:

```yaml
configs:
  - source: nginx_blocked_ips
    target: /etc/nginx/conf.d/blocked_ips.conf
    mode: 0440
```

**Use configs for:**
- Nginx config snippets (blocked IPs, rate limits)
- Application config files
- Feature flags
- Anything non-sensitive that changes independently of the image

### Long-Form Volume Syntax

For more control over mounts, use the long-form syntax:

```yaml
volumes:
  # Named volume (Docker-managed)
  - type: volume
    source: grafana-data
    target: /var/lib/grafana

  # Bind mount (host path)
  - type: bind
    source: /docker/swarm/aws-nginx
    target: /var/log

  # Read-only system mounts (for monitoring)
  - type: bind
    source: /proc
    target: /host/proc
    read_only: true
```

### Host Path Volumes for Persistent Logs

For logs that need to survive container restarts AND be accessible from the host:

```yaml
volumes:
  # Docker volume (isolated, Docker-managed)
  - aws-nginx:/var/log

  # Host path (accessible from host, persists across deploys)
  - /docker/swarm/aws-nginx:/var/log
```

Host path volumes are useful when:
- You need to access logs from the host for shipping
- External tools need to read container logs
- You want logs to survive `docker system prune`

### Network Share Volumes (CIFS/SMB)

Mount a Windows/Samba network share as a Docker volume:

```bash
docker volume create \
  --driver local \
  --opt type=cifs \
  --opt device=//nas-server/share-name \
  --opt o=username=USER,password=PASS,domain=DOMAIN,uid=1000,gid=1000 \
  my-network-volume
```

Then use it in your compose file:

```yaml
volumes:
  my-network-volume:
    external: true
```

**Use cases:**
- Shared storage across multiple Swarm nodes
- Accessing existing NAS storage
- Shared uploads/exports directories

**Note:** For production, use Docker secrets or environment variables for credentials instead of hardcoding them.

### Ulimits for Memory-Hungry Services

Elasticsearch and similar services need memory locking:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.0
  ulimits:
    memlock:
      soft: -1
      hard: -1
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 4096M
      reservations:
        memory: 1024M
```

### Health Checks in Compose

```yaml
services:
  visualizer:
    image: yandeu/visualizer:dev
    healthcheck:
      test: curl -f http://localhost:3500/healthcheck || exit 1
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 5s
```

## Complete Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

Here's a production-ready monitoring stack for Docker Swarm:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  grafana:
    image: portainer/template-swarm-monitoring:grafana-9.5.2
    ports:
      - target: 3000
        published: 3000
        protocol: tcp
        mode: ingress
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
          - node.labels.monitoring == true
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: grafana-data
        target: /var/lib/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${GRAFANA_USER}
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_PASSWORD}
      - GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
    networks:
      - monitoring

  prometheus:
    image: portainer/template-swarm-monitoring:prometheus-v2.44.0
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
      - '--log.level=error'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--storage.tsdb.retention.time=7d'
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
          - node.labels.monitoring == true
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: prometheus-data
        target: /prometheus
    networks:
      - monitoring

  # Container metrics - runs on ALL nodes
  cadvisor:
    image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:v0.47.0
    command: -logtostderr -docker_only
    deploy:
      mode: global  # One instance per node

    networks:
      - monitoring

  # Host metrics - runs on ALL nodes

      - '--path.procfs=/host/proc'
      - '--collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points=^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($$|/)'
      - '--no-collector.ipvs'
    deploy:
      mode: global  # One instance per node
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 128M
        reservations:
          memory: 64M
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /
        target: /rootfs
        read_only: true
      - type: bind
        source: /proc
        target: /host/proc
        read_only: true
      - type: bind
        source: /sys
        target: /host/sys
        read_only: true
    networks:
      - monitoring

volumes:
  grafana-data:
  prometheus-data:

networks:
  monitoring:
    driver: overlay
```

**What each service does:**
| Service | Purpose | Mode |
|---------|---------|------|
| Grafana | Visualization dashboards | 1 replica on manager |
| Prometheus | Metrics collection & storage | 1 replica on manager |
| cAdvisor | Container resource metrics | Global (all nodes) |
| Node Exporter | Host system metrics | Global (all nodes) |

**Setup steps:**
1. Label your monitoring node: `docker node update --label-add monitoring=true docker1`
2. Deploy: `docker stack deploy -c monitoring.yaml monitoring`
3. Access Grafana at `http://your-manager:3000`

This gives you visibility into CPU, memory, disk, and network usage for both containers and hosts.

## Modular Compose Files with Extends

> **Important:** The `extends` keyword only works with `docker compose up` for local development. It does **not** work with `docker stack deploy`. For Swarm deployments, use multiple `-c` flags instead: `docker stack deploy -c base.yml -c production.yml mystack`

For large projects in **local development**, split your compose files and use `extends`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml (main file)
version: "3.8"
services:
  nginx:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose_nginx.yaml
      service: nginx

  nodeserver:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose_node.yaml
      service: nodeserver

  mailserver:
    extends:
      file: docker-compose_mail.yaml
      service: mailserver

# Shared definitions
volumes:
  nginx-logs:
  nodeserver-logs:
  mailserver-logs:

networks:
  awsnet:
    external: true
    name: awsnet

secrets:
  # File-based (for development)
  app_secrets:
    file: ./.secrets/secrets.json

  # SSL certificates
  nginx_server_pem:
    file: ./.secrets/ssl/server.pem
  nginx_server_key:
    file: ./.secrets/ssl/server.key
```

Then each service has its own compose file:

```yaml
# docker-compose_node.yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  nodeserver:
    image: yourregistry/nodeserver:${VERSION:-latest}
    dns:
      - 10.10.1.122
    init: true
    # ... full service definition
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to manage large stacks
- Teams can own their service configs
- Cleaner git diffs
- Reusable service definitions

---

## Secret Management (Stop Using Environment Variables!)

Docker secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit. They appear as files in `/run/secrets/SECRET_NAME`.

### Development vs Production Secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  app_secrets:
    # DEVELOPMENT: Load from local file
    file: ./.secrets/secrets.json

  app_secrets_prod:
    # PRODUCTION: Reference pre-created secret
    external: true
```

```bash
# Create external secret for production
docker secret create app_secrets ./secrets.json

# Or via Portainer's GUI
```

### Multiple Secret Types Example

```yaml
secrets:
  # Application secrets
  gg_secrets:
    file: ./.secrets/secrets.json

  # Mail server credentials
  mail_sasl_passwd:
    file: ./.secrets/mail_sasl_passwd

  # SSL certificates (yes, these can be secrets!)
  nginx_dhparams_pem:
    file: ./.secrets/nginx_ssl_certificates/dhparams.pem
  nginx_server_pem:
    file: ./.secrets/nginx_ssl_certificates/server.pem
  nginx_server_key:
    file: ./.secrets/nginx_ssl_certificates/server.key
```

In your Dockerfile, set proper permissions:
```dockerfile
# For sensitive files like SASL passwords
RUN chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd && \
    chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```

In your application, read `/run/secrets/app_secrets` instead of using env vars for sensitive data.

**Why secrets > env vars:**
- Not visible in `docker inspect`
- Not in image layers
- Encrypted in the Raft log
- Only sent to nodes that need them
- Proper file permissions can be set

---

---

## Useful Commands Cheatsheet

### Node Management
```bash
# List all nodes
docker node ls

# Take node offline for maintenance
docker node update --availability=drain docker2.yourdomain.io

# Bring node back online
docker node update --availability=active docker2.yourdomain.io

# Force service rebalancing after adding node back
docker service update --force nodeapp
```

### Stack Operations
```bash
# Deploy/update a stack
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack

# List stacks
docker stack ls

# View stack services
docker stack services mystack

# View tasks (containers) in a stack
docker stack ps mystack
```

### Service Operations
```bash
# Scale a service
docker service scale mystack_web=4

# View service logs
docker service logs -f mystack_web

# Force update (repull image & redeploy)
docker service update --force mystack_web

# Inspect service details
docker service inspect mystack_web
```

### Cleanup
```bash
# Remove unused images, containers, networks
docker system prune

# View resource usage
docker stats
```

---

## Load Balancing with Nginx

Run Nginx as a Swarm service for:
- SSL termination (or use AWS ALB)
- Static asset caching
- Reverse proxy to your app service
- Rate limiting and WAF

```yaml
nginx:
  image: "yourregistry/nginx:latest"
  deploy:
    replicas: 2
    placement:
      max_replicas_per_node: 1  # One per node for redundancy
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "443:443"
  networks:
    awsnet:
```

Nginx proxies to your app using the service name:
```nginx
upstream app {
    server mystack_nodeserver:61339;
}
```

Docker's internal DNS resolves `mystack_nodeserver` to all healthy replicas, and you get round-robin load balancing for free.

---

## Common Gotchas & Troubleshooting

### Problem: Containers can't communicate between nodes
**Solution:**
1. Verify the overlay network exists and is attached to both services
2. Check DNS config in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`
3. Ensure required ports are open (TCP/UDP 7946, UDP 4789)
4. If using `--opt encrypted`, ensure Protocol 50 (ESP) is allowed and you're using internal VPC IPs

### Problem: Service stuck in "Pending" state
**Solution:**
```bash
docker service ps myservice --no-trunc
```
Usually it's resource constraints - the scheduler can't find a node with enough CPU/memory.

### Problem: Node shows "Down" after reboot
**Solution:**
```bash
docker node ls
# Remove the duplicate/stale node entry
docker node rm <stale_node_id>
```

### Problem: Portainer Agent disconnected
**Solution:**
Remove and recreate the agent service:
```bash
docker service rm portainer_agent
# Re-run your portainer agent setup script
```

### Problem: Rolling update hangs
**Solution:** Check health checks aren't too strict. Temporarily loosen them or increase `start_period`:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s  # Grace period for startup
```

### Problem: Need to debug network traffic
**Solution:** Use `tcpdump` to inspect traffic on the host:
```bash
# Filter traffic on port 80 and show the real client IP
tcpdump -A 'port 80' | grep realip

# Watch all traffic to a specific service port
tcpdump -i any port 61339

# Capture to file for later analysis
tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap port 80

# Watch DNS queries (useful for debugging service discovery)
tcpdump -i any port 53
```

### Problem: Container can't resolve service names
**Solution:** Check Docker's internal DNS is working:
```bash
# From inside a container
nslookup myservice
dig myservice

# Check /etc/resolv.conf in container - should show 127.0.0.11
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

---

## Final Tips

1. **Use Portainer** - It's free for small deployments and makes Swarm management so much easier

2. **Always use external networks** - Create them before deploying stacks so you control the configuration

3. **Tag your images properly** - Never use `latest` in production. Use commit hashes or semantic versions

4. **Set resource limits** - A container without limits can kill your entire node

5. **Test your rollback** - Deploy a broken image intentionally to see rollback work

6. **Document everything** - Your future self will thank you

7. **Take snapshots** - Before major changes, snapshot your nodes (if on cloud)

8. **Separate dev and prod configs** - Use different compose files (see below)

---

## Development vs Production Configurations

Keep separate compose files for dev and prod. Here's how I structure it:

### Development (`docker-compose_dev.yaml`)
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - LOG_LEVEL=debug
    restart: always
    deploy:
      replicas: 1  # Single replica for dev
    networks:
      network:
        ipv4_address: 10.5.0.10  # Static IP for dev debugging

networks:
  network:
    driver: bridge  # Bridge network for single-host dev
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.5.0.0/16
          gateway: 10.5.0.1
```

### Production (`docker-compose_node.yaml`)
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    dns:
      - 10.10.1.122  # Internal DNS
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: ${NODESERVER_REPLICAS}  # Variable replicas
      placement:
        max_replicas_per_node: ${MAX_NODESERVER_REPLICAS_PER_NODE}
      # ... full deploy config
    networks:
      awsnet:  # Overlay network for multi-host

networks:
  awsnet:
    external: true  # Pre-created overlay
    name: awsnet
```

**Key differences:**
| Aspect | Development | Production |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Network | Bridge (single host) | Overlay (multi-host) |
| Replicas | 1 | Variable via env |
| Container names | Static | Dynamic |
| Debug logging | Enabled | Disabled |
| Resource limits | Relaxed | Strict |
| DNS | Default | Internal DNS server |

---

## CI/CD Versioning & Deployment Workflow

Getting versioning right is crucial for debugging production issues. Here's how to set up proper version tracking.

### The Version File Approach

Create a version file that gets updated by your build pipeline:

```
# /path/to/project/globals/_versioning/buildVersion.txt
1.2.45
```

Your CI/CD script reads this and passes it to Docker:

```bash
# pushToProduction.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Read version from file
BUILD_VERSION=$(cat ./globals/_versioning/buildVersion.txt)

# Get git commit hash
LONG_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Build with version info
docker compose build \
  --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$LONG_COMMIT \
  --build-arg BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION

# Push to registry
docker compose push

# Deploy to swarm
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack
```

### Complete Deployment Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Configuration
REGISTRY="yourregistry"
SERVICE="nodeserver"
COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml"

# Read version
BUILD_VERSION=$(cat ./globals/_versioning/buildVersion.txt)
LONG_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
SHORT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

# Export for docker-compose
export BUILD_VERSION
export LONG_COMMIT
export DOCKER_BUILD_VERSION="${BUILD_VERSION}"

echo "Building version ${BUILD_VERSION} (commit: ${SHORT_COMMIT})"

# Build images
docker compose -f $COMPOSE_FILE build

# Tag with version AND latest
docker tag ${REGISTRY}/${SERVICE}:latest ${REGISTRY}/${SERVICE}:${BUILD_VERSION}

# Push both tags
docker compose -f $COMPOSE_FILE push
docker push ${REGISTRY}/${SERVICE}:${BUILD_VERSION}

# Deploy to swarm
echo "Deploying to swarm..."
docker stack deploy -c $COMPOSE_FILE mystack

echo "Deployed version ${BUILD_VERSION} successfully"
```

## Conclusion

Docker Swarm isn't as flashy as Kubernetes, but it's incredibly capable for production workloads. We've been running it for years with minimal issues - the key is getting the networking, DNS, and Dockerfiles right from the start.

**What we covered:**
- The complete Swarm hierarchy (Swarm → Nodes → Stacks → Services → Tasks)
- VPS requirements and cost planning across providers
- Production-ready installation and initialization
- DNS configuration that actually works
- Encrypted overlay networks
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles with ModSecurity WAF
- Advanced compose patterns (cache_from, placement constraints, global mode)
- Docker Configs vs Secrets
- Full rollback configuration
- Complete Prometheus + Grafana + cAdvisor monitoring stack
- Docker Management Platforms (Portainer, Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, Dockge)
- CI/CD versioning and deployment workflows
- Secret management done right
- Dev vs Prod configurations

If you're considering Swarm vs K8s, ask yourself:
- Do you have a dedicated platform team? → K8s might be worth it
- Small team needing "good enough" orchestration? → Swarm will save you countless hours
- Need to ship fast with battle-tested patterns? → Swarm + these configs = production ready

The configs in this guide have been refined over years of production use. Take what you need, adapt it to your stack, and save yourself the debugging time I went through.
